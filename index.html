          <h1>WORD<br>MATTERS.</h1>
          <h2>On 8 January 2021, the Twitter account @realDonaldTrump which belongs to the 45th President of the United States - Donald Trump was permanently suspended due to the risk of further incitement of violence ("Permanent suspension of @realDonaldTrump", 2021). The suspension of Trump’s Twitter account was expected from years ago, based on the fact that many controversial topics were created by him on this social media platform since 2009.<br><br>Being one of the most powerful men on this planet, Trump could tweet on his own will, and express whatever he wants - even when the content he published were false accusations or offensive to others. Yet, one of his many 'appropriate' phrases - "Chinese virus" immediately received swift and backlash after he tweeted on March 16, numerous people considering him as fueling anti-Aisan American sentiment(Kandil, 2020).</h2>

            <h3>EARLY PRAISE FOR CHINA</h3>
            <p>In the periods between late January to early February in 2020, the United States President Donald Trump has <strong>repeatedly praised Chinese President Xi Jinping’s response</strong> to the coronavirus outbreak crisis(McDermott & Kaczynski, 2020): </p>
            <h4>“China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!” tweeted by Trump on January 24.</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Once again on February 7, the <strong>Chinese President was praised by Trump</strong> for his handling of the crisis (McDermott & Kaczynski, 2020):</p>
            <h4>“Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong, sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well, even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy, but he will be successful, especially as the weather starts to warm & the virus hopefully becomes weaker, and then gone. Great discipline is taking place in China, as President Xi strongly leads what will be a very successful operation. We are working closely with China to help!”</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>From 24 January to 5 March, Trump <strong>has been using the phrase “Coronavirus”</strong> when mentioning the issue on Twitter, along with the neutral, less-specific phrase - “virus”.</p>
            <h3>THE TRIGGER</h3>
            <p>According to the article “Donald Trump’s ‘Chinese virus’: the politics of naming” published on THE CONVERSATION (Viala-Gaudefroy & Lindaman, 2020), the author addressed Trump’s role in his <strong>favorable view of China’s leadership,</strong> is due to his <strong>concerns over the US-China trade deal,</strong> fear that his speech would <strong>upset Beijing and result in jeopardizing the deal.</strong> The article (Viala-Gaudefroy & Lindaman, 2020) also referred to an investigation conducted by the New York Times, which discovered that Trump has been <strong>resisting to take on the hard line</strong> like many officials in his administration do. His formal expression towards COVID-19 <strong>lasted until the 16 March,</strong> where he was informed that a <strong>Chinese official named Zhao Lijian</strong> - the spokesperson of China(where Twitter is banned)’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted on the 12 March (Winter, 2020):</p>
            <h4>“When did patient zero begin in the US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owes us an explanation!”</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>This conspiracy theory spreaded by the Chinese official evidently upset Trump. As you can see from the graph above, he began using the phrase <strong>“Chinese virus”</strong> from 16 March and used this phrase up to <strong>three times</strong> on 18 March. Moreover, the <strong>sentiment value</strong> of these three tweets <strong>dropped drastically from 0.26 down to -0.25.</strong> </p>
            <br>
            <p>Interestingly, on March 27, Trump <strong>suddenly stopped</strong> using the phrase <strong>“Chinese virus”</strong> and went back addressing COVID-19 as <strong>“Coronavirus”:</strong></p>
            <h4>“Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail inthe CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>It is believed that it had something to do with the favorable view of China’s leadership once again, since the Chinese President was mentioned in this tweet as well. Undoubtedly, Trump himself was <strong>clearly conscious</strong> whether the phrase “Chinese virus” is <strong>appropriate or not.</strong> He could have kept using the phrase “Chinese virus” if he felt <strong>confident</strong> that the word itself would not impact his relationship with the Chinese President - the boss on the other side of the table. Meaning he was well aware that the Chinese President has the authority to <strong>call off the US-China trade deal at any time.</strong> </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, throughout the rest of 2020, Trump’s phrasing has been <strong>switching back and forth</strong> between “China virus”, “Chinese virus”, “Coronavirus” and “COVID-19”. As you can see from the pie chart below, the appearance ratio of the phrase <strong>“China virus”</strong> on Trump’s tweet has taken up to <strong>22.4%,</strong> while <strong>“Chinese virus”</strong> has taken up to <strong>6.06%.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>THE CONSEQUENCE</h3>
            <p>Despite the fact that the Chinese official is the one who put up the conspiracy theory, Trump has <strong>completely dismissed the impact</strong> of his phrase “Chinese virus” on <strong>Asian Americans</strong> like THE CONVERSATION() suggested. When he encountered with accusation of racism, he defended himself by stating the virus was in fact originated from China (Viala-Gaudefroy & Lindaman, 2020):</p>
            <h4>“It’s not racist at all. No, it’s not at all. It’s from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.” (March 18)</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>According to a study published by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco (Bostock, 2021), the 16 March, 2020 tweet from Trump was <strong>directly responsible for a major increase in anti-Asian hashtags.</strong></p>
            <p>According to NBC news (Kandil, 2020), the online reporting forum 'Stop AAPI Hate' has received more than <strong>650 direct reports of discrimination against primarily Asian Americans</strong> since its inception on 18 March.</p>
            <p>According to a study conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino (Yam, 2021), <strong>attacks against Asians in the US increased by 150% in 2020.</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Referring to the NBC news (Kandil, 2020), the president and executive director of the civil right group Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAAJ, believed that <strong>Trump’s phrasing has an impact</strong> and commented:</p>
            <h4>“The deliberate use of terms like “Chinese virus” has definitely fanned the flames of racism toward Asian Americans in this country” </h4>
            <hr>
            <h4>“We have seen people associate the virus with Chinese people as they are assaulting them. It’s outrageous for any elected official to have been dismissive when the evidence of racist attacks continues to climb. Words matter and they often hold more weight when spoken by our politicians.”</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Hence, <strong>word matters,</strong> the president's own use of the Twitter account was <strong>clearly presented as a danger to public safety,</strong> which was demonstrated in this case of using the phrase "Chinese virus", not to mention the <strong>2021 United States Capitol attack</strong>, where rioters were Trump's supporters and listened to his call through Twitter. As the one of the opinions published on The Washington Post (Lampa, 2021) suggested, <strong>"The government should accordingly retain control over the account when the president leaves office."</strong> Hence, any US president in the future should have their social media account <strong>operated by the US government</strong> and carefully handled by the team of <strong>Public Relations.</strong></p>
